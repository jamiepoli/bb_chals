# BB Chals

[I've organized many CTFs](https://jamvie.net/chals/). Some challenges don't make the cut, usually cause they're too broken or too easy. The latter ones are stored here for practice. 

## Status

| Challenge                 | Status |
| ------------------------- | ------ |
| Vie1                      | 😴     |
| F1                        | ❌     |
| Salem Summer Camp         | ✅     |
| Cold Brew                 | ❌     |

### Legend
* ❌ - challenge is not ready.
* ✅ - challenge is ready and live.
* 😴 - challenge is ready, but asleep. You can solve it locally though. 

## TODO
* Ask Zardus really nicely if I can put a bb vie dojo in PWN.COLLEGE
