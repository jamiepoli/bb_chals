MOM CAN YOU COME PICK ME UP THEY'RE FLOATING ABOVE THE BONFIRE AGAIN

This is a beginner-friendly challenge that invites players to understand side channels. There exist many in the world and way too many for me to reasonably explain with 1 challenge. Instead, this tries to showcase to players how to find or utilize a side-channel using a toy one I made for this challenge.

No hints will be given unless no one solves this challenge, in which a public hint may be provided. 

If you find the flag, feel free to DM it to me and I can verify. 

Let's treat this like a legit CTF challenge. I'd rather you not share the flag or share hints outside of what has already been discussed publicly. 

This challenge should be solvable if you're willing to apply yourself. It's not solvable in a few minutes (I think?) but you won't need a month to solve it either. 

After some time I can talk about this chal and maybe even provide a writeup once I stop procrastinating on writing my PlaidCTF and GoogleCTF author writeups.

To run this challenge:

```
docker-compose up --build
```
