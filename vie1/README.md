# Vie ez chal 1

This is a beginner-friendly challenge that invites players to understand path canonicalization.

No hints will be given unless no one solves this challenge, in which a public hint may be provided. 

If you find the flag, feel free to DM it to me and I can verify. 

Let's treat this like a legit CTF challenge. I'd rather you not share the flag or share hints outside of what has already been discussed publicly. 

This challenge should be solvable if you're willing to apply yourself. It's not solvable in a few minutes (I think?) but you won't need a month to solve it either. 

After some time I can talk about this chal and maybe even provide a writeup once I stop procrastinating on writing my PlaidCTF and GoogleCTF author writeups.

To run this challenge:

```
docker build . -t vie1
docker run -p 8081:8081 -t vie1
```
