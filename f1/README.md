# FORMULA ONE

SCUDERIA FERRARI ES MI RELIGIÓN

This is a beginner-friendly challenge meant to encourage players to get familiar with client-side APIs. There will be many that will pop up in a client-side challenge, and in this case, players ideally will learn about a few very common ones through this challenge.

No hints will be given unless no one solves this challenge, in which a public hint may be provided. 

If you find the flag, feel free to DM it to me and I can verify. 

Let's treat this like a legit CTF challenge. I'd rather you not share the flag or share hints outside of what has already been discussed publicly. 

This challenge should be solvable if you're willing to apply yourself. It's not solvable in a few minutes (I think?) but you won't need a month to solve it either. 

After some time I can talk about this chal and maybe even provide a writeup once I stop procrastinating on writing my PlaidCTF and GoogleCTF author writeups.

To run this challenge:

```
docker build . -t formula && docker run -p 8990:8990 -t formula
```
